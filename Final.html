<a name="toc"><h2><center>Translating James Paul Gee's Principles of Learning via Video Games into the Classroom</center></h2></a>

<p>Video games, it turns out, are excellent teachers. In order to begin playing with a video game's system, the game itself must 
first instruct a player on the rules of that system. Or rather, they should. This is why <a href ="#gee">James Paul Gee</a>,
the noted sociolinguistics and video game scholar, specifies <i>good</i> games in the title of his 2007 book, <a href="#good"><i>Good Video 
Games + Good Learning</i></a>. Gee makes the argument that "good video games are thinking tools" (17), and that they force players to both learn 
a set of rules while also encouraging experimentation (15-17). Good games achieve this, he argues, because they adhere to a set of 
<a href="#thirteen">thirteen principles of good learning</a> that are built into the media of well-designed video games. Though 
Gee outlined these principles as an attempt to point out what video games do particularly well, the points he establishes hold true
for more conventional pedagogical situations as well, though some might <a href="#feasible">not initially seem intuitive or feasible</a>, 
regardless of the correctness of Gee's claims. I argue, however, that Gee's points are not only feasible in a traditional classroom, but should be, 
whenever possible, adhered to partly because his concepts are grounded in how students actually learn (<a href="#gee">the result of his nearly thirty years of 
education research)</a>, and 
also partly because the precepts that <a href="#feasible">seem most difficult to create in a real classroom </a>are only difficult if one insists on adhering 
to their digital nature. 

<p>In 2011, <a href="#fyfe">Paul Fyfe</a> wrote an article called 
<a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000106/000106.html">"Digital Pedagogy Unplugged"</a> which argues that the insistence
that digital humanities (an umbrella under which video games fall) need not necessarily be taught in a digital framework. That is, principles
of data structure, organization, experimentation, and display of knowledge that is created to be digital native, need not necessarily be so.
Just as it is possible to <a href="#purpose">construct an analogue, tradtional pen and paper essay in the framework of digital technologies</a>, so too
is it possible to flip the other way, to convert something inherently digital into an analagous framework. This paper argues that combining
Gee's principles of good learning with Fyfe's concept of non-digital digital humanities creates an effective classroom model, which can be 
<a href="#composition">applied to early English composition and literature courses.</a>

 <br><br><br><a name="justification"><br><br><b>Justification for the Project</b>
<p> The consolidation of <a href="#gee">James Gee's</a> understanding of what makes video games good for learning with 
<a href="#fyfe">Paul Fyfe's</a> willingness to abandon the digital part of digital humanities is a project that underscores 
the importance of using technology not only as a tool, but as a way to reframe our ways of thinking. The 
principles that Gee outlines are not only true of video games, but they are also true of pedagogy in general. 
Without the technology, however, to provide a different frame of reference, it is possible that no one 
would have really ever paid attention to the importance of something like <a href="#9">the fish tank</a> or 
<a href="#4">distributed knowledge</a>. Having a video game avatar that knows something that I don't 
is an interesting framework for thinking about group work (and also the importance and role of those 
you collaborate with. Are you the protagonist and they are merely in-game bots who do your bidding?) With 
the newfound model of thinking that video games (and technology more generally) provides, we can consider, 
reconsider, and perhaps revise our traditional models of education and how we approach pedagogy. The 
emphasis is on the methodologies, not necessarily the ability to be a viking warrior in a video game. 
What does being a viking warrior teach us on a systemic level? These are the questions we should be 
asking and considering the answers when reflecting on pedagogy. 
<p>On a different level, I started this project to test out and stretch the defining features of what 
makes the academic essay. Must it always be a twenty-five page long, sustained argument? Or can it 
consist of "chunks" of information that all contribute to the overall argument without necessarily being 
so linear or acting like a scaffolding. If I were to remove a section here or there, would the argument 
still remain? This is the kind of model I am striving to create (somewhat unsuccessfully). The notion of 
"clicking down" into the argument to bring up new information if and when it seems useful to the reader 
was attempted by my anchor links. In reality, this form is not particularly great, and was not exactly 
what I had in mind. Thanks to time constraints, I had to resort to this method which is functional, but 
breaks up the reading, something I had wanted to avoid. I just noticed while writing this paper that 
Wikipedia (of all places) seems to now be doing exactly what I had envisioned when I began composing this 
paper; the links that invariably dot the articles (much like this one) are now hoverable, which pops up 
with a little window that previews the information found in that link. This is perfect, even if Wikipedia 
did beat me to the scoop. I think that if this format is to flourish, it is imperative that the reader is 
never inconvenienced by being directed away from what they are reading unless the reader specifically 
chooses to do so. The sustained thought is more important, I think, than the ability to dig a little 
deeper into a tangent.
<p>Finally, while I would not consider the content nor the format of this essay to be especially well 
executed, I do feel that I have hit upon an interesting method of teaching writing. The need to constantly 
assess and ask myself, "What will people be wanting to click on?" has given me a kind of outside 
observer perspective of my own writing and has allowed me to think critically about what I am putting 
on the page. Further, (and this would, I think, be handy for a freshman composition course) by thinking 
about what links to create and where to cite, I have literally created a list for myself of all the discrete 
ideas that are going into my paper. Not only does this allow me to question and think about my own argument, 
but it gives me a definite sense of direction - I know exactly what to write about next. This method, I 
think, could be modified and taught to an English 101 course because of its self-reflexive nature and 
the way that it helps a writer to stay organized and focused.

<b><h2><center>Gee's Thirteen Principles of Good Learning</center></h2></b></a>
<b>1.	Co-Design:</b>
<p>"In a video game, players make things happen. They don't just consume what the 'author' (game 
designer) has placed before them. Video games are interactive" (23).Essentially, Gee is suggesting a 
form of interactive learning in contrast to passively-received knowledge. Gee argues that well-designed 
video games teach players the "rules" while the player, in turn, experiments with how far those rules 
can be stretched. <br><br> 
<b>2.	Customization of learning:</b>
<p>"Good games achieve [customization] in one (or both) of two ways. In some games, players are able to 
customize the game play to fit their learning and playing styles. In others, the game is designed to 
allow different styles of learning and playing to work" (24). Gee's point here is twofold: firstly, a
 player can choose what to experience (do I want to be a warlord or a peacemonger?) but also how it is 
 experienced (what difficulty do I want to play on?). 
</a><br><br>
<b>3.	Identity: </b>
<p>"Deep learning requires an extended commitment and such commitment is powerfully recruited when 
people take on a new identity they value and in which they become heavily invested" (24)  Gee suggests 
that with the creation of and investment in a particular persona, players care more about both the 
virtual world the avatar inhabits, as well as how they themselves situate within that virtual world. 
<br><br>
<b>4.	Manipulation and Distributed Knowledge:</b>
<p> "The character the player controls ... knows things the player doesn't...The player knows thing 
the character doesn't... The player and the character each have knowledge that must be integrated 
together to play the game successfully" (26). Video games allow the players to have a specific kind of 
expertise - for example, the expertise of knowing where and when to move, while the diegetic avatar 
takes care of knowing how to scale a wall or start a fire - without the need to know every part of a 
system. This suggests a dependency on collaboration. 
<br><br>
<b>5.	Well-ordered problems:</b>
<p> "The problems learners face early on are crucial and should be well designeed to lead them to 
hypotheses that work well, not just on these problems, but as aspects of the solutions of later, 
harder problems, as well" (27). This is basically Gee's argument against freeplay, i.e., that a player 
(or student) should not just be handed the game and told to play it; they need to learn <i>how</i> to 
play it, and there must be a scaffolding in place in order to promote a level of mastery before 
allowing the player to move on (see point seven, below).<br><br>
<b>6.	Pleasantly frustrating:</b>
 <p>"Learning works best when new challenges are pleasantly frutrating in the sense of being felt by learners
 to be at the outer edge of, but within, the 'regime of competence.; That is, these challenges feel 
 hard, but doable" (28). This is the argument that a good video game  (and by extension, good pedagogy) 
 should never become so easy as to be boring. Further, a challenge  should be  present, but not so 
 challenging that the player (student) gives up in frustration. 
 <br><br>
<b>7.	Cycles of expertise:</b> 
<p>"Good games create and support the cycle of expertise, with cycles of extended practice, tests of 
mastery of that practice, then a new challenge, and then new extended practice" (30). The purpose of 
this is twofold in a game: to allow the players to experience "fun" in the form of a sense of personal 
skill and achievement, and then to force them to reconsider and synthesize the  knowledge they have 
gained up to that point. <br><br>
<b>8.	Information 'on demand' and 'just in time': </b>
<p>"Human beings are quite poor at using verbal information (i.e., words) when given lots of it out of 
context; and before they can see how it applies to actual situations" (30). Basically, this is Gee's 
argument in favor of situated learning, i.e., learning information at the moment that it is needed and 
in the context that it would be useful. In video games this often takes the form of a message that pops 
up on the screen informing the player that they  need to push X button or try using Y technique to make 
it past a particular challenge. 
<br><br>
 <b>9.	Fish tanks: </b>
 <p>"Good games offer players fish tanks, either as tutorials or as their first level or two. Otherwise 
 it can be difficult for newcomers to understand the game as a whole system, since they often can't see 
 the forst because of the trees" (31). This is an extension of Gee's well-ordered problems principle above. 
 Gee argues that it is useful to provide a stripped-down version of a complex system in order to teach 
 a player or student something that might otherwise be overwhelmingly complex. 
<br><br>
<b>10.	Sandboxes: </b>
<p>"Sandboxes are game play much like the real game, but where things cannot go too wrong too quickly, or 
perhaps, even at all... You can't expect newcomers to learn if the feel too much pressure, understand too 
little, and feel like failures" (32). This notion ties into point number thirteen below; players learn best 
by doing, and they should (especially in the early stages of mastering a system) be able to 'play' with the 
system without any fear of serious reprisal should they fail. This is similar to the fish tanks (tutorials)
, above. <br><br>
<b>11.	Skills as strategies: </b>
<p>"In good games, players...see the skills first and foremost as a strategy for accomplishing a goal and 
only secondarily as a set of discrete skills" (33). Here Gee argues (again) for situated learning; the 
individual skills that a player masters as they play a game are only means to an end. I want to beat this
 boss or this level, thus I need to work on improving my jumping skills to avoid his attacks. It is not 
 necessarily the case that the player wants to be a great jumper, but rather, the skill of jumping is 
 necessary to achieve a greater goal. In short, players need a larger goal - skills alone are not interesting.<br><br>
<b>12.	System thinking: </b>
<p>"Good games help players see and understand how each of the elements in the game fits into the overall 
system of the game and its genre(type)" (34). Gee's argument here is similar to that above; players rarely 
learn or understand a skill until is being employed in the service of something larger. Whenever I encounter 
a tough boss that requires well-honed jumping skills, I understand that the mastery of the skill is being 
used in order to achieve my greater goal; I do not learn how to triple jump just for fun, but rather, because 
I understand that within the greater context of the game, I will need that skill in order to proceed. <br><br>
<b>13.	Meaning as action image: </b>
<p>"Humans do not usually think through general definitions and logical principles. Rather, they think through
experiences they have had and imaginative reconstructions of experience" (35). Here, Gee makes the 
argument that the only way to get better at a particular game's mechanics or to understand the systems 
that the game operates under, is to actually sit down and play with those systems. Further, though 
failure to achieve a task or learn how to do something in the game will almost certainly happen, that 
failure must not be too devestating lest the player give up, discouraged. For example, losing a life and 
being forced to restart a level is 'acceptable' failure in a player's eyes; being forced to start the 
game all over from scratch is less so. Even when  failure is encountered the player should still feel 
as if progress is being made.
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<div><a name="stem"><br><br><b>The Problems with James Gee and English</b></a>
<p>One of the principle criticisms one could levy against James Gee's methodology is that he often assumes 
that a student is operating from a STEM perspective, rather than from a humanities field. As such, some 
of his ideas about how video games teach well do not apply quite as smoothly to English as one might 
hope. Specifically, he often seems to suggest an eventual "mastering" of a given subject (33). This idea 
is less prevalent in the humanities, and in English in particular, wherein a student is encouraged to consider 
the multivalent meanings a text produces or to approach problems from a multitude of angles. This issue 
is somewhat less of a problem for composition courses, however, as there exists a <a href="#iupobjectives">
distinct set of objectives</a> that the university wants students to accomplish. In other words, there are 
specific, identifiable indications if a student is "mastering" composition. Can they write clearly? Do they 
have a workable thesis? Is their writing properly cited and sourced? Still, the language is somewhat ambiguous. 
For example, what, specifically, is "significant content" as listed in the objectives? This problem is exacerbated 
when we consider literature courses. How does one measure success at reading Austen when one of the core tenants 
of English is that readings are multivalenced and interpretable? With this is mind, let's consider some of 
Gee's "problematic" principles.<br><br>
<b>Distributed Knowledge and Manipulation: </b>This one does not have to be a problem in the humanities, and 
yet it is, especially in the field of English. Essentially, Gee argues for a high level of scholarly cooperation
in this point, something that is rarely done, particularly at the graduate level, in English. Scholars 
typically write alone (occasionally in pairs) and typically do not divvy up "specialties" in quite the 
same way that STEM fields do. Personally, I feel that this is less a fault of Gee's and more an indication 
of a systemic problem with how the humanities (English) views itself. I am in favor of more collaboration. <br><br>
<b>Well-Ordered Problems:</b> This assumes that there is a specific order to how things should be taught, 
that there is a ladder to be climbed. This assumption is not terrible when considering STEM disciplines -  
one should probably learn how to calculate the load-bearing capabilities of a bridge before actually 
trying to construct one - but is not super useful for English. Is there any reason other than a somewhat 
arbitrary justification for teaching short stories before poetry? Thus, this point applies better to 
STEM fields than to the humanities. 
<br><br><b>Pleasantly Frustrating:</b> While Gee's idea here is sound pedagogy - a student should be pushed 
to do what is at the limits of their skill, but not <i>too</i> far - it is more difficult to adapt to 
an English course. Similar to the point above, how does one judge what is difficult for a student? Is 
reading Hemingway categorically more difficult than Hurston? How does an instructor differentiate 
between an 'easy' text versus a 'difficult' one? Is it the language? The depth of metaphor and allegory?
The subject matter? It is relatively easier to identify when a math problem or science experiment is 
getting more complicated; it is less so in English, and makes Gee's point, though very valid, more 
difficult to actually implement.

<br><br><b><a name="1">Principle 1: Co-Design:</b><p></a>
Perhaps best understood in the context of Paolo Freire's <a href="#freire"><i>Pedagogy of the 
Oppressed</i></a>, James Gee advocates student-centered learning. To borrow language from Freire, 
"education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the
poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers <i>and</i> students" (72). In short,
students must become active learners, that is, they decide what to learn, how they best learn it, 
identify their own strengths and weakness, and then work with the teacher to shore up any conceptual 
weaknesses or shortcomings. This is the opposite of what Freire dubs the "banking model" of education,  
which he (and Gee by extension) feel is too instructor-focused: "The teacher is the Subject of the 
learning process, while the pupils are mere objects" which "minimize[s] or annul[s] the students'
 creative power" (73).
<p>For Gee, of course, the concept of the <a href="#flipped">flipped classroom</a> and the existence of 
a simultaneous teacher-student takes place in the realm of video games. Gee argues (correctly so) that 
video games possess Freire's concept as an inherent property of the medium (23). Playing a video game 
is always experimental ("What can I do? How do I do it?") and pedagogical ("Well, that didn't work" or 
"That worked!").
<p> So how to implement this in an English composition course? Probably the simplest way would be to 
allow students more control over what they write about. Some students certainly perfer to have a topic 
chosen for them, however, I feel that it would prove to be more beneificial to think about points 
<a href="#11">eleven</a> and <a href="#12">twelve</a> in the context of what that particular student
intends to do professionally or academically and tailor the content of the course toward some larger 
goal that still accomplishes <a href="#iupobjectives">the learning objectives of the university</a> while still 
allowing for a degree of creativity. In this respect, I feel that one of the first lessons and first 
writing assignments should be to 1) demonstrate some of the creative possibilities that a student could 
attempt (for example, maybe they want to tailor their writing towards being able to publish in a scientific 
journal or maybe they want to be a novelist - work with what their ambitions are) and 2) Ask the student to
 create a tentative statement of that plan. What do they want to accomplish? What do they see themselves 
 as? I feel that this is very doable in the context of a composition class and will provide the students with 
  stakes, a feeling of responsibility, and <a href="#3">an identity</a>.
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="2">Principle 2: Customization of Learning</b><p></a>
"Players can usually, in one way or another, customize a game to fit with their learning and playing 
styles" (Gee, 2005, 35), Gee writes. This principle is not, he argues, adequately addressed in modern school
systems, and is typically only really embraced by special needs teachers who must create an <a href="<a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/iep.index.htm">">
individualized education plan for their students.</a> Gee makes the claim that what video games do 
particularly well is that the level of customization is designed by the student/player according to 
the intersection of the game's requirements with the personal interests and "style"
 of the individual learner. Applying this to a hypothetical classroom, he writes, "Customized curricula 
 in school would not just be about self pacing, but about real intersections between the curriculum 
 and the learner’s interests, desires, and styles" (Gee, 2005, 35). Again, the largest difference between current
  curricula and what Gee sees happening in video games lies in principle one, above: the student 
  customizes according to what they see as valuable and worthy of pursuit (while still abiding by the 
  systemic rules and requirements of the video game/classroom).
<p> This principle is similar to the one above, but it also hits on <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com/overview/">
Styles of Learning</a>, and being considerate of the differences in students' individual learning methods. 
Of course, pedagogical instructional courses emphasize using a variety of teaching styles to avoid alienating
 and students who might learn differently, but I feel like this point needs to be considered in conjuction
with point one, above. Students, too, should be aware of how they learn best and seek to tailor their own 
education. In co-designing a composition class with a student, the teacher and student should both be self-
conscious about the preferred learning style of the student and design a course that caters to that specific 
need. Of course, this would imply that a teacher needs to do vastly more work than might otherwise be 
required. Typically, even a teacher who is aware of various learning styles can only teach a given lesson one, 
maybe two ways at a time, for example, by putting notes on the board while lecturing. If a teacher is to be 
conscious and aware of all the learning styles simultaneously, they will essentially have to recreate a 
lesson five different ways, each time catering to a different style. 
<p> This is where student co-design becomes important. Obviously, it would be impossible for an instructor 
to be mindful of every variation in learning styles for every lesson. It is not impossible, however, for 
the students themselves to be aware and mindful of how they learn, and then to take part in the teaching 
of the class using whatever learning methodology works best for them. Students could prepare, as part 
of their preparation for a given lesson, a demonstration of how they think some particular bit of knowledge 
works or should work, and then discuss it with the class using their particular style. This means that the 
students, however, are being asked to learn material on their own and do something with it even before 
the instructor has had an opportunity to guide them. This sounds like a bad idea at worst, idealistic 
at best. And yet, <a href="#10">it is this very principle that James Gee suggests</a>. As long as the 
student is free to 'play' with the material, secure in the knowledge that they will not be meaningfully 
punished for failing to grasp an idea, then it encourages experimentation, experience, and allows them 
a creative outlet and personal style that works for them. 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="3">Principle 3: Identity</b><p></a>
 Gee writes, "...academic area are not first and foremost bodies of facts; they are, rather, first and foremost, 
 the activities and ways of knowing through which such facts are generated, defended, and modified" (25). 
 A fundamental property of playing video games lies in the avatar-player relationship, i.e., the player 
"becomes" another person and is thus invested in what happens to that virtual other self. Gee sees self-
identification as a necessary component to education, primarily because it creates stakes for the 
student. It would not be unreasonable for a person to read point number two above and suggest that many
students would be inclined to create customization for their personal curricula that allows them to 
achieve the easiest 'A' possible. Gee argues that by allowing the students to create an imagined "avatar", 
a persona to which they are committed, then the pitfalls of allowing a student too much freedom can be
sidestepped. Further, he argues that identifying with a persona is integral to education. He writes, "no 
deep learning takes place unless learners make an extended commitment of self for the long haul" (Gee, 2005, 34). 
Video games, as mentioned, have identification built-in to their design. Classrooms, however, can - and 
should - foster this form of self-indentification which will encourage students to both take curricula 
customization seriously, but will also give them an "identity goal" to shoot for. For example, if I 
identify as a novelist, I can look to other novelists to figure out what I need to learn and thus tailor 
my learning towards that goal (again, while still 'playing' within the confines of the rules). I have 
already touched upon this premise in <a href="#1">point one</a>; allow the student to co-design the course 
based upon the identity that they want to create for themselves. 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="4">Principle 4: Distributed Knowledge and Manipulation</b><p></a>
Gee argues that in video games (and in STEM fields in particular), knowledge is distributed across 
several actors (whether that be game players or contributors to a journal paper). 
 at IUP. 
  <p> This principle is fairly ignored in English departments and particularly in composition courses; the 
  problem of course being that we need and expect each student to be able to construct a reasonably-well 
  composed essay, often with research and citation. All classes have a set of mandatory standards that 
 students must reach; often, these standards are skill specific, such as <a href="#iupobjectives">those in the English 101 courses
 at IUP </a>The default method of achieving this is to have each 
  indvidual student write their own essay. This makes sense, but creates a feeling of isolation. Rarely (if 
  ever) will students work in isolation once they reach the workplace; communication, sharing of ideas, 
  delegating responsibility, and distributing knowledge are the norm. Largely only academics work in 
  near isolation, and of those solo academics, most tend to be situated in humanities departments. STEM, 
  with its complex level of systems analysis, almost requires collaboration and distribution of knowledge 
  and responsibilities. How, then, to prepare students for a world in which collaboration is the norm, yet 
  still meet and be able to assess individual student writing outcomes? 
  <p> If we instead re-envisioned these standards to reflect Gee's points eleven and twelve, <a href="#11">
 Skills as strategies</a> and <a href="#12">System thinking</a>, then students could (as per <a href="#2">
 point number two</a>) allow students to better customize their learning according to what interests 
 them and what better serves the identity they have created for themselves; this would allow for "specialists"
 who can contribute individual skills and talents to a greater project (in theory, the course itself), a 
 situation which more closesly mirrors the real world. Very few people know everything about everything;
  most jobs require a distribution of knowledge to both facilitate the construction of something greater 
  (i.e., a project) as well as to ease the burden of how much one individual needs to master to be a 
  useful contributor to a given project.
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
  <br><br><br><b><a name="5">Principle 5: Well-Ordered Problems</b><p></a>
<p> This technique is pedagogically referred to as "scaffolding," i.e., giving students a problem that 
they must master before providing them with a slightly more difficult problem that relies on 
the previous lesson, etc. Instructors gradually ramp up the difficulty until students are able to complete 
a task or can demonstrate mastery in a skill that ordinarily would be too complex or demanding for an 
uninitiated learner. This is a fairly commonplace pedagogical method, but it is used less effectively in 
the humanities as opposed to the STEM disciplines. The foundation upon which skills like math and sciences 
are built relies on scaffolding because there is a very clear understanding of what needs to be learned 
first (e.g., you need to know how to add before multiplying makes sense) whereas in English it is 
significantly more difficult to find "requirements." Do I teach narrative writing first? Or compare and 
contrast writing? Does the order matter? In literature, do we cover short stories first because they are 
accessible or poetry because it contains the figures of speech which will be found throughout all 
literature? Thus far, much of the scholarship on scaffolding in English deals with <a href="#ell">either 
teaching English as a second language </a> or to be used in <a href="#primary">primary schools. </a> Neither
of these scenarios apply to a generic composition course at IUP, however, largely because students at 
this level are generally simply exposed to a variety of literature via survey courses; there appears to 
be no hierarchical reason to teach one thing before another in literature, aside from the preferences and 
personal justifications of individual instructors. 
<p>This is because, I feel, that the focus on scaffolding is fixated on content. <a href="#gee">James Gee</a>
writes, "School is often built around the 'content fetish,' the idea that an academic area like biology 
or social science is constituted by some definitive list of facts or body of information" (25). Unfortunately,
 the "body of information" for English is essentially the entirety of literature. Scaffolding based on 
content does not work for English; however, scaffolding based on <i>ways of thinking </i> does.  
Gee's principles <a href="#9">nine, Fish Tanks</a> and <a href="#10"> ten, Sandboxes </a> suggest a 
different method of learning: namely, rather than starting from the "ground-up," and mastering the content,
 students learn better when thrown into the deep end of the pool, as it were. They do not need to know a 
"definitive list of facts or body of information" because 1) that is not a good model of how humans 
actually learn and 2) because those facts are meaningless without content. 

<a name="bloom"><center><img src="bloom.png" /> </center></a>

<p>This is a much better method of organizing scaffolding at the college English level. Rather than attempting 
to build a model that says "Poetry first because it teaches X, Y, and Z, followed by short stories because 
of reasons A, B, and C" it is far better to embrace scaffolding the models of knowing and understanding. I 
don't think this thought is particularly ground-breaking from an English perspective, but it does 
underscore the <a href="#stem">inherent STEM bias in Gee's arguments</a>. To summarize, Gee suggests that 
video games are good at teaching well-ordered problems because they build upon previously learned skills, 
 he (supposedly) criticizes STEM education because of its "content fetish." In some ways he is arguing with 
himself here: is scaffolding of content important or not? I feel that content is significantly less 
important in English and the humanities more generally than scaffolding how students think.  
 <br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="6">Principle 6: Pleasantly Frustrating</b><p></a>

<p>This is a sound argument for video games and also for teaching in general, but it becomes a bit more 
problematic when applied to composition or literature courses. In essence, the student should be challenged 
cognitively by the material with which they are confronted. The problem is how is difficulty being 
perceived in English? Is reading Poe more difficult than reading Kincaid? Is writing a compare and 
contrast essay significantly harder than a narrative response? How do we evaluate the difficulty of <a href="#iupobjectives">us[ing] 
writing processes to generate, develop, share, revise, proofread, and edit major writing projects"?</a>
<p>Gee's answer lies in principle <a href="#2">number two</a>, that students should be able to adjust the 
"difficulty slider" of their classroom so that they remain on the outer edge of doable but difficult (29). 
The problem with this is that it assumes that the students 1) know where that limit is and 2) have a 
desire to push themselves, both are suppositions which are unlikely to be true. I feel that by embracing 
the notion of the <a href="#9">Fish Tank</a>, students will naturally be pushed to this edge; that is, 
by throwing them into the deep end of the literary pool without scaffolding content, (but scaffolding 
understanding!) students will naturally rise or sink to their level of competence. A struggling student 
might simply respond to <i>Moby Dick</i> with a paper that simply seeks to understand the content while 
a more advanced student might compose a paper that discusses the allegorical themes that run amok in the 
text. In both instances, however, the student has hit their natural level (knowledge and analysis, respectively).
 It then falls on the instructor to push the student to the next order of knowledge (understanding and 
evaluation). Gee suggests that by using this "difficulty slider", students should be graded on their 
ability to perform at their respective level and their ability to reach towards the next. 
<p>He writes, "They realize that it doesn't matter when the player finishes or how he or she did in comparison to others - all 
that matters is that the player learns to play the game and comes to master it" (29). Essentially he is 
arguing not only for differentiated instruction, but also differentiated grading. Doubtlessly, this would 
not sit well with many in the academy, and yet I cannot help but think that there is probably some merit 
to his argument; by keeping school "pleasantly frustrating" students will continue to improve, and it 
does not particularly matter in the end how quickly that improvement comes. Real-world situations (deadlines, 
graduation dates, etc.) of course complicate this matter, but I think that differentiated grading may be 
a viable pedagogical method for a majority of students. Questions of fairness doubtless would arise, 
but that is only if our emphasis is hierarchical (which students performed the best?) versus pedagogical.  

<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="7">Principle 7: Cycles of Expertise</b><p></a>
Cycles of expertise are standard in video games. They are instances in which players master a particular 
skillset and then are allowed to "play" with it before being challenged with a new task. The interesting 
idea at the core of cycles of expertise is that they are fun. Players get a moment to experience, for a 
time and before it becomes boring (because they are <i>too</i> good) a feeling of accomplishment. This 
can and should be encouraged in the classroom as a form of engagement, and also because it allows for 
growth. Students become aware that they are no longer having difficulty with a particular task and thus 
become less resistant to moving on. 
<p>There are two ways that this can be accomplished: first, by appealing <a href="#2">to customization </a> 
and second, by being aware of when a student has reached their <a href="#6">"natural level"</a> and 
allowing them a chance to combine their mastery with a new skill or technique. In the first instance, 
though a student might not be great at composing an essay of some length because they hate writing, that 
does not mean that they are rhetorically defunct. They might possess some other form of expressive media 
in which they excel that could also be used to demonstrate their understanding of material. To use a 
simplistic example, if I am trying to teach metaphor and require students to write an essay about <i>
Moby Dick</i>, some students will have mastery of the form (essay) while others may not. By allowing them 
 a different outlet (poetry, for example), or perhaps even a different form of media to express their 
 understanding of how metaphor works, they will have an opportunity to experience the fun of mastery 
 (presumably they would pick something they are good at and enjoy) while still demonstrating their understanding 
 of the concept. Basically, I propose giving students dual-assignments, which is to say, students need 
 to demonstrate competence in something <a href="#6">difficult but doable </a>,but should be encouraged to 
 combine this with a sense of mastery, by employing technique, media, rhetoric, etc., that they understand 
 and can have fun with. 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="8">Principle 8: Information "On Demand" and "Just in Time"</b><p></a>
This very essay is an exercise in this principle. Information out of context is generally meaningless, 
and thus the idea of a textbook or a lecture given in a vacuum is typically not all that useful for 
students. Instead, they should be thrown into <a href="#10"> a sandbox</a> and allowed to play with 
the systems that they are required to learn. Whenever they encounter something unexpected or that sparks 
their interest, students should be able to pull up that information in the moment. This puts the raw 
knowledge component that sat at the bottom of <a href="#bloom">Bloom's pyramid</a> in a context in which 
the information makes sense. My <a href="#justification"> section expands on this idea.
</a>
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="9">Principle 9: Fish Tanks</b><p></a>
"Fish tanks are stripped down versions of the game" (31), according to Gee. In a classroom setting, 
these fish tanks would simply be called "examples" - small demonstrations of a larger problem or 
idea. And yet, particularly in the composition class, fish tanks can be more than just an example; as 
<a href="#13">principle thirteen argues</a>, students learn best by <i>doing</i> rather than passively 
absorbing knowledge. (<a href="#brain">The brain reacts differently to interactive learning than passive
learning.</a>) Thus, fish tanks can be employed as a form of practice for the students. Rather than 
assigning a number of larger essays that require students to process and synthesize a significant amount 
of material at once, smaller, shorter assignments that single out specific concepts allow students to 
get a better understanding of exactly what that concept is, and have more opportunities to practice 
that concept. The problem arises on the instructor's end, however: in a class of forty plus composition 
students, how much honest and thoughtful feedback can the teacher reasonably expect to provide? The answer 
lies in principles three and twelve, <a href="#3">identity and <a href="#12">system thinking</a>. A 
community can be created amongst the students that has larger stakes than their individual accomplishments 
to provide them with a sense of responsibility both for their own education as well as that of their 
peers. 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="10">Principle 10: Sandboxes</b><p></a>
"Sandboxes in the real world are safe havens for children that still look and feel like the real world" (32), 
Gee writes. Taking this idea into the classroom, he is suggesting that, just like in a video game's 
tutorial level wherein a player cannot fail, so too need there be places where students can experiment 
without fear of failure or reprisal. This is the <a href="#6">second time </a> Gee suggests a dramatic 
retooling of our methods of evaluation. The problem, Gee suggests, is that school is "too risky and punishing" (32)
and that students need time for 'horizontal learning' (<a href="#bibliography">Goto</a>), that is, 
they need to have the opportunity to play in their sandbox before they are challenged meaningfully. 
<p> Implementing this in a composition course means that students need to <a href="#11">write more, smaller 
things</a> as a way to experiment with the material to be learned. These writing samples do not need 
to be graded in a permanent way, but they should have responsive feedback. As mentioned <a href="#9">
in the prior point, this can be achieved via <a href="#12">system thinking</a>, by giving the students 
a larger project to be invested in which necessarily removes the stress of individual performance. The 
thinking goes, if the students are asked to create a number of small assignments that allow them to 
practice the skills being learned, which are then collected into a larger project created by the 
community of scholarship of the classroom, students will create an identity they can take pride in 
(being part of a larger goal), and receieve and give feedback with their peers. These small assignments 
need not have a final letter grade attached to them, yet the community working together will stil be 
able to provide the individual student with feedback (and also removes some of the burden of grading 
from the instructor, which is a plus). 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="11">Principle 11: Skills as Strategies</b><p></a>
This point directly ties into <a href="#10">the principle above</a>; I advocate (and Gee echoes the sentiment)
 that the only way to understand something is to do it, and to do it a lot. And yet, as Gee points out, 
 "there is a paradox involving skills: people don't like practicing skills out of context over and over 
 again, since they find such skill practice meaningless, but, without lots of practice, they cannot get 
 really good at what they are trying to learn" (33). In other words, if I suggest that students shoudld 
 write more, smaller texts, then the risk is run that they will hate it because of boredom, repetition, etc.
 The way to avoid this problem is by nesting the rote repetition in the context of a larger skill. For
 example, I could create a project wherein we (the class) will together compose a volume of short short stories 
 to be published online. If I tell the students they have to write five short shorts each so we can all 
 vote on which is the best, the repetition of writing the narrative is no longer done in a vacuum; the 
 skill has context. We practice because we want to get better so we can have something decent to offer 
 the rest of the class for our larger project. Which, incidentally, brings us to the next point...
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="12">Principle 12: System Thinking</b><p></a>
It is difficult to separate System Thinking from using Skills as Strategies because they both embrace 
the notion that an individual skill or student should be part of a larger whole. In point eleven, the 
project of writing a number of short short stories is in the service of a greater project, a class-created 
and published collection of short stories. System thinking is similar (this small part is piece of a 
greater whole) but also applies to the student and particularly to <a href="#3">their identity</a>. 
By creating a project for the student to become invested in, one in which his or her identity is 
grounded in connection with his or her fellow students, the work is changed from a chore that a student 
must complete in order to receive an A in the course into their contribution of a larger whole. This 
method, I feel, also assuages some of the stress caused by individual assessment. 
<br><br><a href="#toc">Return to Argument</a>
<br><br><br><b><a name="13">Principle 13: Meaning as Action Image</b><p></a>
Doing is better than absorbing information <a href="#brain">because of how our brain works</a>.
Essentially, when we encounter experience interactively, (in a video game, for example), our brain 
reacts as if it were in the moment doing the action. This, too, translates to learning. When we read 
about a concept or an experience, our brain literally activates different parts of the brain than when 
we actually <i>do</i> it. With this in mind and with a stress on the imporatance of <a href="#8">contextual 
knowledge, </a>it is imperative that students practice, practice, practice. This is not simply because for 
the sake of rote memorization, but because it is only by actually doing and seeing how things work and 
fit together can they ascend <a href="#bloom">Bloom's pyramid</a> to deeper levels of thinking. Noting 
that the top "tier" of knowledge according to Bloom is that of creation, it stands to reason that the 
very thing which we should push students toward is more doing. More assignments, not less, and more 
emphasis on useful feedback, not grading. This allows a student to explore, to play, and to learn. 
This principle is essentially another iteration of the pedagogical standard of <a href="#flipped">the 
flipped classroom</a>.

Though it may occasionally seem intrusive, it is often important in critical play studies to make a distinction
 between what is going on in the real world, i.e., what is the player physically doing right now, at 
 this moment while he or she is playing the game, versus what is going on <i> in the game itself</i>, 
 i.e., diegetically occuring on the screen. This convention is one I have personally adopted because much 
 of my other critical play scholarship focuses on the interaction between the screen and the physical player.</a>

<p>Neuropsychology researchers have corroborated the idea that our brain has problems distinguishing 
between reality and media while playing games; in a study published in PLOS ONE in 2012, a group of 
scientists tested how the brain responded to interactive media versus passive media. The results found 
that “mesolimbic activation was significantly more pronounced in the active playgroup than in the passive
 exposure control group” and that “these findings suggest that IDG-induced activation of reward-related 
 mesolimbic neural circuits stems primarily from participatory engagement in gameplay (interactivity), 
 rather than from the effects of vivid and dynamic sensory stimulation” (Cole, et al). 
 In layman’s terms, this study suggests that the brain’s response to events happening in a video game 
 are more closely aligned to how a mind reacts if an event were actually occurring to the player rather 
 than merely being watched. Or, as Isbister puts it, “To the human brain, playing a game is more like 
 actually running a race than watching a film or reading a short story about a race” (Isbister, 3).
