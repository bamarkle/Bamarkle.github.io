<h1> Justification <h1>
This final project is not, I feel, particularly interesting in and of itself when you look at the final project - much like my last mini-project. But for me what stands out is that it represents a process. What I have done is to boil down the theory covered in the ENGL 956 class in a simple, digestible format. I've rewritten every summary that currently exists on the Wiki (except my own) and tried to boil those ideas down into simplified, easy-to-digest bullet points. For the record, this is no easy task for some authors (looking at you, Derrida). The results appear on the next page and they are not complete - I think I've only made it to Benjamin thus far. This takes longer than it may appear at first glance. 
<br> 
What I find interesting, though, is not the end result, but the process of creating the website/Twine. I mentioned this briefly in our final class, but I feel that the power of technology lies in its interactivity. In the paraphrased words of Buddha (maybe - I've seen a multitude of attributions to the pithy quote): "To read is to forget, to be shown is to understand, but to do is to know." I feel that by listening to your lectures or by reading the responses of my fellow students I have a reasonable understanding of the theory we were to learn. However, I feel that by working on this self-imposed task of condensation, I am much better versed in the theory than I ever could be through another method. This is guiding my potential research - the notion that through doing, through using a call and response, input and output interface readily craftable through digital technology, we may somehow, in some small way, be able to create better pedagogy. 
<br>
So again, while this Twine is certainly useful in its own right, I feel that the process of creating it was far more useful to my own understanding.
