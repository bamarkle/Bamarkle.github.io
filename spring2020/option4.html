    <h1>That's not a regular rule; you invented it just now.</h1>
        Select a different media format you could potentially use for your evaluation essay that's NOT words on a paper. <br><br>
        1) Identify the new media<br><br>
        2) Identify at least two tools you could use to help create the essay (e.g., if you're doing a podcast you might identify Adobe Audition and Apple GarageBand)<br><br>
        3) List the affordances and constraints of the new media (e.g., you can hear things, but you can't see things, etc.)<br><br>
        4) Copy/paste some locations online that you can use for resources/help about your media (forums, webpages, digital manuals, etc.)<br><br>
        5) Explain why you are thinking about using this media and what you hope it will bring to the project that pen and paper would be lacking.
