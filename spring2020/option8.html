            <h1>Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!</h1>
            Depending on how you identify politically, visit one of these three news sites:<br><br>
            <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker (identify as Democrat)</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/">Fox News (identify as Republican)</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal (identify as Independent or other political leaning)</a><br><br>
            Browse an article or two of your choosing and identify where you find biased language. 
            Answer the following: <br><br>
            What is being said and why do you think this is biased (or carefully worded)? <br>
            Is this the kind of language the audience would expect to hear? Why? <br>
            Why might this be problematic or even dangerous (either for the reader or the writer)?<br>
            Attempt to rewrite the sentence(s) in a more neutral style.<br><br>
            *Note: If these sites seem arbitrary, I simply based them <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/21/lets-rank-the-media-from-liberal-to-conservative-based-on-their-audiences/">on this study.</a>
