<h1>Long Bones</h1>
<p> I created this Twine with the intention of exploring what interactive fiction can do that a traditional story or book cannot. My personal philosophy regarding interactive fiction is that it should make use of the media's ability to display more than text, and its ability to force the reader to choose. To this end, my horror story tries to make use of the visual and auditory components as much as possible to enhance the setting and mood of the story. I would have liked to add some video components as well, but was unable to thanks to time constraints.

<p>A few notes before you begin:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It's not done! If you're looking at this page and this message still exists, I recommend waiting to play. It should be finished before today (Friday) is done. So just hold your horses (unless you're Dr. Sherwood and just feel like grading right now). </li>
  <li> Sound on, headphones preferrably. Since I think that one of the strategic advantages of Interactive Fiction is the audio component, I've added lots of sound effects</li>
  <li> Play through more than once. I mean, you <i>can</i> play only once, but you'll be missing out.</li>
  <li> That's all! Enjoy <a href="LongBones.html">Long Bones!</a></li>
</ul>
