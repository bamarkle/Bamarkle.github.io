<h1>Long Bones</h1>
<p> I created this Twine with the intention of exploring what interactive fiction can do that a traditional story or book cannot. My personal philosophy regarding interactive fiction is that it should make use of the media's ability to display more than text, and its ability to force the reader to choose. To this end, my horror story tries to make use of the visual and auditory components as much as possible to enhance the setting and mood of the story. I would have liked to add some video components as well, but was unable to thanks to time constraints.  The project itself is an attempt to create an urban legend, inspired by stories like the Slenderman myth and the Rake. Incidentally, all the images in this slideshow are pictures of those two urban legends.

<p>A few notes before you begin:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Praise the sun! It's done! Well, sort of. I need to actually add stuff to the credits page, but since I have now been working on this for 7 hours straight, it's time for a break! </li>
  <li> Sound on, headphones preferrably. Since I think that one of the strategic advantages of Interactive Fiction is the audio component, I've added lots of sound effects</li>
  <li> Play through more than once. I mean, you <i>can</i> play only once, but you'll be missing out.</li>
  <li> That's all! Enjoy <a href="LongBones.html">Long Bones!</a></li>
</ul>
